# DATABASE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
I have developed a secure database management system that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. The system provides features such as authentication, access control, live helpline, encryption algorithms, live alerts, approval/disapproval requests, and activity tracking/logs.
